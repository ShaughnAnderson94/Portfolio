## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility
## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

Here we see a form from my agency project. The HTML code clearly lets the screen reader know there is a form which requires information and then a submit button.


## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient color contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

![Screenshot of code that creates that contrast](/photos/contrast-code.png)

Here we see text on top of an image from the agency project. This text is made visible by having shadow that creates maximum contrast
## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

Light house and The A11y Project checklist are both useful tool's I've learned to help ensure I meet accessibility criteria.
## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

Here we see a media query from the agency project that will adjust how things are displayed depending on the screen size.
## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

When testing the website the inspect tool can be used to simulate how a website would run on mobile. This allowed me to develop mobile first.
## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colors to HTML elements
![Screenshot of a css variables being declared including colors ](/photos/colors.png)

A group of colors can be declared as css variables and this allows them to be used repeatedly throughout the website.
## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)
![Screenshot of css code to give the flex properties to an object and its children](/photos/flexchildC.png)

This bit of css code from the agency project was applied to a parent object causing all the children to be displayed in a column (or row off of mobile)
## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story
????????????????????????????????????????????????????
## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
![Screenshot of a form with the POST input type](/photos/code-form.png)

This form has the post input type which allowed it to send information to another page running on the same server which would then display it.
