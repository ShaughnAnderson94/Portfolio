## 1. Write code that executes asynchronously
## 2. Use callbacks to access values that aren’t available synchronously
## 3. Use promises to access values that aren’t available synchronously
## 4. Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses

In the api project this asynchronous function was run to get info from a recipe web site and begin to work with it. Initially the information wont be availible from the api since the fetching takes some time. The code is written with promises that will fulfill in the code after the api has responded to the fetch request.
## 5. Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests
??????????
## 6. Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values

???????
## 8. Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors
????
## 9. Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page
?????
## 10. Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties
??????
## 11. Use consistent layout and spacing
?????
## 12. Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel
?????
## 13. Debug client side JS in our web browser
?????
## 14. Use console.log() to help us debug our code

In this function the results are console logged as a way of seeing if this function not returning the vaules we expect it to could be a source of problems
